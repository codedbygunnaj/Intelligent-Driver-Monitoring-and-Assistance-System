# Driver Monitoring System 🚘👀

An AI-powered driver safety system that integrates **Drowsiness Detection**, **Emotion Recognition**, and **Gesture Control** into a single, real-time pipeline. The project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Deep Learning models** to monitor driver state and provide timely alerts to prevent accidents.

## 📌 Features

* **Drowsiness Detection** – Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) to detect prolonged eye closure, yawning, and head nodding.
* **Emotion Detection** – Classifies driver emotions (happy, sad, angry, stressed, neutral) using a CNN trained on FER-2013 dataset.
* **Gesture Control** – Enables non-intrusive infotainment control (volume, calls, navigation) using MediaPipe Hand gestures.
* **Real-time Alerts** – Generates audio/visual warnings when unsafe driver states are detected.
* **Cost-Effective** – Works with just a webcam, no additional sensors required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy
* **Dataset:** FER-2013 (for emotion detection)
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
